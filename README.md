# hotkey

Bunch of stuff for hotkey management, whatever that means.

> Disclaimer: I don't know exactly what I want. So I am exploring the domain by
trying some related software and doing some small protoype. Trying to take notes
at the same time.

P.S.
> I do that kind of exploration all the time, but it is the first time I do it
in public :flushed:. I thinks that helps to be slightly more organised; although
this repo started as a dump for my unused AHK scripts.
